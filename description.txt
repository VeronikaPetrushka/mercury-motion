Title: Lead with Mercury Motion

Description: 

Lead with Mercury Motion is a cosmic-inspired app that helps you stay on track with your goals and personal growth. 
It’s built for those who want more focus, more clarity, and a gentle push forward each day. 
Set simple daily tasks, write reflections that keep you grounded, and read motivating articles that feel like stardust for the mind. 
Use the calendar to follow your own orbit of progress, and play a short space game where you guide Mercury to catch beams of light. 
This app is for anyone who looks up at the sky and feels the pull to become better — one small motion at a time.
